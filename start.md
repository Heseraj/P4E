## Work with Markdown

"Hello World!"

This is to start a markdown file.

According to the instrcutor, the atom markdown was the best markdown text editor ever.
I can see that it works they way I want. Now, I can write python code on this file?

`python`

`x = 2 `

`x  = x + 2 `

So, all of these came about using luck rather than figuring out what i was doing.
so, is this the new change
